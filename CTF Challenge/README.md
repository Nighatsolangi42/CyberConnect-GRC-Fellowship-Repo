**OBEDIENT CAT CHALLENGE**

Challenge Overview

The objective of this challenge was to retrieve the hidden flag from a downloadable file provided in the task. The challenge focused on basic file inspection and command-line investigation skills.


**Technique 1: Manual File Inspection**

This approach demonstrates simple file analysis using a text editor.

Step 1: Download the File

The file provided in the challenge was downloaded to the local system.

Step 2: Open the File

The downloaded file was opened using a text editor such as Notepad.

Observation

After opening the file, the flag was clearly visible in plain text within the file contents. No additional decoding or manipulation was required.


**Technique 2: Command-Line Investigation (Using wget and cat)**

This method demonstrates basic command-line skills for file retrieval and inspection.

Step 1: Download the File Using wget

wget <file_url>
This command downloads the file directly from the server to the local machine.

Step 2: Display the File Contents Using cat

cat <filename>
The cat command prints the contents of the file directly to the terminal.

Observation

The flag was immediately visible in the terminal output after running the cat command.

Summary

Both techniques successfully revealed the flag. The challenge reinforced the importance of checking file contents directly, whether through a graphical text editor or via command-line tools. Sometimes, simple inspection is all that is needed.
